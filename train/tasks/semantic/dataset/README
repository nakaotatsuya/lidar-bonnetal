SemanticKITTI semantic segmentation training data
=================================================

Version: 1.0

See http://www.semantic-kitti.org for more information on the dataset and updates.


Change Log
----------
Version 1.0: initial release.


Contents
--------

This archive contains the labels for sequences 00-10 of the KITTI odemetry 
benchmark. We provide furthermore the poses (poses.txt in each folder) used to 
annotate the labeled sequences for all sequences (including the test set 
sequences).

See http://www.semantic-kitti.org/dataset.html#format for more information on 
the data format. We also provide Python code to read and visualize the data, 
which is available under http://www.semantic-kitti.org/resources.html#devtools.
